/** ONE set, and the two populations inside it guarded separately.
 *
 *  This used to guard `__recallSet.json` and `__recallSetPlus.json` together,
 *  because the first cannot name a programme-split child and guarding on it
 *  alone would enshrine that blind spot in CI. That reasoning stands; the two
 *  files do not. Both carried the unrepaired sibling attribution, under which
 *  the answer for 24% of pairs is close to a uniform draw over the delivering
 *  bodies of one notified scheme -- a floor over a random label is a floor over
 *  noise. The active set fixes the labels, adds the children AND carries the
 *  leak-free descriptions, so one file now covers what two did.
 *
 *  The blind-spot protection is kept, and made stricter: the two populations
 *  live inside the one set and are floored SEPARATELY, so a change that buys
 *  programme children with SATR leaves — or the reverse — fails here instead of
 *  netting out to a flat headline. That is the trade bf3056d made explicit, and
 *  it is now measured on one sample rather than inferred across two files.
 *
 *  Floors sit just under the measured numbers, never at an aspiration. A gate
 *  set where we wish we were fails on day one, gets ignored, and protects
 *  nothing. Pool is the one correctness floor rather than a ranking score -- a
 *  fund the writer never sees cannot be advised on at all -- so it is set
 *  hard; EXACT@5 and REGIME@5 sit further below because both carry real
 *  sampling noise, and the per-population figures carry more of it at n<100. */
/*  ── RE-DERIVED against the seeded sampler (2026-08-06) ───────────────────
 *  The previous floors — pool 90, EXACT@5 20, REGIME@5 85, and 74/88 per
 *  population — were calibrated against a measurement this file took by
 *  STRIDE, on a set whose ordering stride aliases against. 95f5fce replaced
 *  the harness's sampler and did not reach this file, so the gate and the
 *  measurement it floors were sampling differently: the numbers those floors
 *  sat five points under (pool 95 / EXACT 25 / REGIME 91) are not reproducible
 *  by any unbiased draw. They are not lowered here so much as re-measured.
 *
 *  Measured on the leak-free corpus, tune split, seeded shuffle, n=300 at the
 *  pinned seed, __recallSetComposed.json — with the three-seed spread at n=600
 *  beside it, which is what says how much of the margin is noise:
 *
 *                        n=300 pinned      n=600, seeds 20260806 / 7 / 99
 *      pool                    (see below)        96  94  95
 *      EXACT@5                                    20  18  17
 *      REGIME@5                                   80  79  80
 *
 *  Floors sit ~5 points under the pinned measurement, the margin this gate has
 *  always used, and the seed and N are both pinned so the residual sampling
 *  noise inside that margin is ZERO — the same sample every run. The margin
 *  therefore covers a corpus refresh or an embedding rebuild, not the draw.
 *
 *  Pool is the one correctness floor rather than a ranking score — a fund the
 *  writer never sees cannot be advised on at all — so it is set hard; EXACT@5
 *  and REGIME@5 sit further below because a real ranking change moves them by
 *  more than it moves pool. */

 *  legitimate refresh can produce. Two of those is the margin, which is what
 *  stops the gate flapping while still catching a population being traded away.
 *
